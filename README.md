# VatnarLib
A graphics library written in C++. The library is designed primarily for learning purposes but also includes some foundational features to support moderate graphic rendering and animations.

### Planned Features
- **Window creation with OpenGL**: Set up a basic window with OpenGL.
- **2D Drawing**: Draw 2D shapes and objects.
- **Colors**: Integrate color manipulation for shapes and backgrounds.
- **Camera movement**: Enable a moving camera for 3D navigation.
- **3D Drawing**: Support 3D shape rendering.
- **Interactive Drawing**: Allow user input for interactive graphics.

### Future Ideas
- **Multithreading**: Enable parallel processing for efficiency.
- **Vulkan Support**: Consider adding Vulkan support for advanced graphics.
- **Multiple Windows**: Allow rendering across multiple windows.
- **Interactive Terminal**: Add a terminal interface for commands and adjustments.

### Implementation Checklist
- [x] **Circle Logic**: Simplified animation with references for circles.
- [x] **Circle API**: Intuitive API for circle creation and manipulation.
- [ ] **Rectangle Refactor**: Improve the rectangle handling process.
- [ ] **Parametric Curves**: Implement parametric curves for smoother shapes.
- [ ] **OpenGL Window Drawing**: Enable OpenGL window rendering.
- [ ] **Pixel Drawing with OpenGL**: Render pixels via OpenGL.
- [ ] **OpenGL Shapes**: Draw points and circles using OpenGL.
- [ ] **Vector Object Drawing**: Enable drawing of vector-based objects.
- [ ] **3D Rendering**: Begin work on 3D implementations.
