<<<<<<< HEAD
VatnarLib is a graphics library written in C++.
It is designed primarily for learning purposes 
but includes foundational features to support 
basic graphic rendering and animations.


## Planned Features
- **Window creation with SMFL**: Set up a basic window with SMFL.

## How to Build and Run

1. **Prerequisites**:
    - **CMake**: Install CMake from [here](https://cmake.org/download/).
    - **C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have a C++20-compatible compiler (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`, or MSVC on Windows).
    - **SFML**: The project fetches SFML automatically during the build process.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Vatnar/vatnarlibcpp.git
    cd vatnarlibcpp
    ```

3. **Build**:
   Using CMake:
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    cmake --build .
    ```

4. **Run**:
   Itâ€™s recommended to run from the command line for logs:
    ```bash
    ./bin/VatnarLib
    ```
